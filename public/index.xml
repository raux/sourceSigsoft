      <description>SIGSOFT focuses on issues related to all aspects of software development and maintenance. Areas of special interest include: requirements, specification and design, software architecture, validation, verification, debugging, software safety, software processes, software management, measurement, user interfaces, configuration management, software engineering environments, and CASE tools. SIGSOFT has sponsors or co-sponsors many conferences and events, and publishes Software Engineering Notes, a quarterly newsletter.
History The field of software engineering is generally considered to have begun with the 1968 and 1969 NATO Software Engineering Conferences.</description>
